# fluctuationsFit

From files measuring radius fluctuations, calculates fft and fit the Helfrich model

## Extract fluctuations FFT

Script to measure the FFT of each results file: [src/measureFFT_time.R](./src/measureFFT_time.R)

For each file found in a given folder (parameter `fold` in the script), calculates the temporal Fast Fourier Transform and writes all the results in the same output file `results_fft.csv`.

## Plot and fit model

Script to plot the FFT results and fit the Helfrich model (see methods of [Almonacid et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580719307397?via%3Dihub)

The script load the result file `results_fft.csv` generated by the previous script in each input folder (condition) indicated by the parameter `conds` in the script.

For each condition, it will plot the fft with the corresponding Helfrich fit.
The coefficients of the fit are written in the output file `helfrich_coefs.csv`.
